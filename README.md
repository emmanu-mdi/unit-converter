## Unit Converter

This is a JetBrains project of the Kotlin basics track to learn how to track changes of files.

### About
When you travel, everything changes: people, languages, time zones, and even units. It may be difficult to read the temperature in Fahrenheit when you’ve always used Celsius, or to measure yourself in kilos if you’ve only used pounds. It’s no easy matter, though a nice unit converter could certainly help! In this project, you will write a converter that handles distance, weight, and temperature units – all the traveller’s essentials.

### Stages
1. **Standard Output** -> Display simple conversion examples: for instance, a standard measurement table.
2. **Let's get metric** -> Teach your program to convert kilometers to meters. 
3. **Distances** -> Teach your program to handle other distance units - yards, feet and inches - and convert them to meters.
4. **Heavy duty** -> Now you can convert all distance units; time to enable your converter to work with weight measure units as well.
5. **Is it getting hot here?** -> Your converter is only missing one thing: temperatures. Teach it to convert Fahrenheir, Celsius and Kelvin, and your ultimate unit converter is ready.
